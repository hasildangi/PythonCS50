a = input("Enter the fist value")
b = input("Enter the second value")
sum = int(a)+ int(b)
print(f"The sum of two number is = {sum}")


#Alternative idea

#using the int function as a whole outside of the input fx
a = int(input("what's x?"))
b = int(input("what's y?"))
print("the required sum is",a+b)
